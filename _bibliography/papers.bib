  title={Leveraging Large Language Models for Explaining Material Synthesis Mechanisms: The Foundation of Materials Discovery},
  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in the advancement of materials discovery, particularly in their role in automation and robotics. However, a key question remains: Do these models operate based on a true grasping of physicochemical principles when designing experiments or interpreting results? Existing evaluations primarily focus on fact-checking tasks such as material property prediction and named entity recognition, while neglecting the reasoning required to grasp fundamental synthesis mechanisms. Furthermore, no previous studies have directly evaluated LLMs‚Äô ability to reason about synthesis mechanisms. To address these challenges, we first develop a benchmark containing 775 semi-manually created multiple-choice questions in the field of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) synthesis for evaluation. Second, we probe the model's output logits to derive precise selection probabilities for the correct answers, obtaining a confidence-based score (c-score) as a quantitative evaluation metric. Additionally, based on this evaluation, we also develop an AI assistant using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to explain AuNP synthesis mechanisms, achieving a 10% improvement in accuracy over the leading model, Claude. Our study highlights the potential of LLMs in recogniz scientific mechanisms and offers a valuable tool for aiding the exploration of more synthesis methods. Moreover, our dataset establishes a foundation for developing highly efficient models with the utilization of material synthesis mechanisms.},

	title={Measuring Solvent Exchange in Silica Nanoparticles with Rotor-based Fluorophore},
    author={Xuejun Cheng and Yingming Pu and Songtao Ye and Xiao Xiao and Xin Zhang and Hongyu Chen},
    abstract={Measuring the diffusivity of molecules is the first step toward understanding their dependence and controlling diffusion, but the challenge increases with the decrease of molecular size, particularly for non-fluorescent and non-reactive molecules such as solvents. Here, the capability to monitor the solvent exchange process within the micropores of silica with millisecond time resolution is demonstrated, by simply embedding a rotor-based fluorophore (thioflavin T) in colloidal silica nanoparticles. Basically, the silica provides an extreme case of viscous microenvironment, which is affected by the polarity of the solvents. The fluorescence intensity traces can be well fitted to the Fickian diffusion model, allowing analytical solution of the diffusion process, and revealing the diffusion coefficients. The validation experiments, involving the water-to-ethanol and ethanol-to-water solvent exchange, the comparison of different drying conditions, and the variation in the degree of cross-linking in silica, confirmed the effectiveness and sensitivity of this method for characterizing diffusion in silica micropores. This work focuses on the method development of measuring diffusivity and the high temporal resolution in tracking solvent exchange dynamics over a short distance (within 165 nm) opens enormous possibilities for further studies.},

	title={Combined Dynamic Virtual Spatiotemporal Graph Mapping for Traffic Prediction},
    abstract={The continuous expansion of the urban construction scale has recently contributed to the demand for the dynamics of traffic intersections that are managed, making adaptive modellings become a hot topic. Existing deep learning methods are powerful to fit complex heterogeneous graphs. However, they still have drawbacks, which can be roughly classified into two categories, 1) spatiotemporal async-modelling approaches separately consider temporal and spatial dependencies, resulting in weak generalization and large instability while aggregating; 2) spatiotemporal sync-modelling is hard to capture long-term temporal dependencies because of the local receptive field. In order to overcome above challenges, a \textbf{C}ombined \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{V}irtual spatiotemporal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{M}apping \textbf{(CDVGM)} is proposed in this work. The contributions are the following: 1) a dynamic virtual graph Laplacian (DVGL) is designed, which considers both the spatial signal passing and the temporal features simultaneously; 2) the Long-term Temporal Strengthen model (LT2S) for improving the stability of time series forecasting; Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDVGM has excellent performances of fast convergence speed and low resource consumption and achieves the current SOTA effect in terms of both accuracy and generalization.},
