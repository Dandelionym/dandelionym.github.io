  title={PiFlow: Principle-aware Scientific Discovery with Multi-Agent Collaboration},
  abstract = {Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific discovery. Existing approaches, however, often automate scientific discovery using predefined workflows that lack rationality constraints. This often leads to aimless hypothesizing and a failure to consistently link hypotheses with evidence, thereby hindering systematic uncertainty reduction. Overcoming these limitations fundamentally requires systematic uncertainty reduction. We introduce \texttt{PiFlow}, an information-theoretical framework, treating automated scientific discovery as a structured uncertainty reduction problem guided by principles (e.g., scientific laws). In evaluations across three distinct scientific domains -- discovering nanomaterial structures, bio-molecules, and superconductor candidates with targeted properties -- our method significantly improves discovery efficiency, reflected by a 73.55\% increase in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of property values versus exploration steps, and enhances solution quality by 94.06\% compared to a vanilla agent system. Overall, \texttt{PiFlow} serves as a Plug-and-Play method, establishing a novel paradigm shift in highly efficient automated scientific discovery, paving the way for more robust and accelerated AI-driven research. <br> <b>(Remark: An Unified framework with strong theoretical guarantee for scientific discovery. )</b>},

  title={PriM: Principle-Inspired Material Discovery through Multi-Agent Collaboration},
  abstract = {Complex chemical space and limited knowledge scope with biases holds immense challenge for human scientists, yet in automated materials discovery. Existing intelligent methods relies more on numerical computation, leading to inefficient exploration and results with hard-interpretability. To bridge this gap, we introduce a principles-guided materials discovery workflow powered by language inferential multi-agent system (MAS). Our framework integrates automated hypothesis generation with experimental validation in a roundtable system of MAS, enabling systematic exploration while maintaining scientific rigor. Based on our framework, the case study of nano helix demonstrates higher materials exploration rate and property value while providing transparent reasoning pathways. This approach develops an automated-and-transparent paradigm for material discovery, with broad implications for rational design of functional materials.},

    author = {Wu, Juanshu and Pu, Yingming and Wang, Jin and Gu, Bing and Chen, Xin and Chen, Hongyu},
    abstract = {Rational design of chiral nanostructures with desired Circular Dichroism (CD)spectra requires a quantitative structure-property relationship, which has sofar been unavailable. Using a data-driven method, the aim is to establish sucha relationship for nanohelices, a prevalent structural element of chiralnanostructures. Given the challenges in synthesizing nanohelices andseparating racemic mixtures, obtaining extensive CD data has been diÔ¨Écult.Instead, CD spectra of 1260 nanohelices are stimulated using Ô¨Ånite-diÔ¨Äerencetime-domain method. This dataset is used to train a convolutional neuralnetwork that can accurately predict the CD spectra using a few key structuralparameters such as pitch and curl. Moreover, an inverse design model isdeveloped that can generate the right helix with the desired CD. To establishquantitative relationships, Shapley Additive explanations analysis and casestudies are devised for the prediction model. The algorithm eÔ¨Écientlyanalyzes the structure-property correlation, revealing the speciÔ¨Åc degrees ofstructural inÔ¨Çuence on the spectroscopic characteristics. Furthermore, theneural-network-based model can be extended via transfer learning to predictCD spectra of nanohelices made of other noble metals (Ag, Cu). It is believedthat AI-based approaches can signiÔ¨Åcantly broaden the scope ofwet-chemistry nanosynthesis and computational techniques in the design ofchiral nanostructures.},

  title={Leveraging Large Language Models for Explaining Material Synthesis Mechanisms: The Foundation of Materials Discovery},
  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in the advancement of materials discovery, particularly in their role in automation and robotics. However, a key question remains: Do these models operate based on a true grasping of physicochemical principles when designing experiments or interpreting results? Existing evaluations primarily focus on fact-checking tasks such as material property prediction and named entity recognition, while neglecting the reasoning required to grasp fundamental synthesis mechanisms. Furthermore, no previous studies have directly evaluated LLMs‚Äô ability to reason about synthesis mechanisms. To address these challenges, we first develop a benchmark containing 775 semi-manually created multiple-choice questions in the field of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) synthesis for evaluation. Second, we probe the model's output logits to derive precise selection probabilities for the correct answers, obtaining a confidence-based score (c-score) as a quantitative evaluation metric. Additionally, based on this evaluation, we also develop an AI assistant using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to explain AuNP synthesis mechanisms, achieving a 10% improvement in accuracy over the leading model, Claude. Our study highlights the potential of LLMs in recogniz scientific mechanisms and offers a valuable tool for aiding the exploration of more synthesis methods. Moreover, our dataset establishes a foundation for developing highly efficient models with the utilization of material synthesis mechanisms.},

	title={Measuring Solvent Exchange in Silica Nanoparticles with Rotor-based Fluorophore},
    author={Xuejun Cheng and Yingming Pu and Songtao Ye and Xiao Xiao and Xin Zhang and Hongyu Chen},
    abstract={Measuring the diffusivity of molecules is the first step toward understanding their dependence and controlling diffusion, but the challenge increases with the decrease of molecular size, particularly for non-fluorescent and non-reactive molecules such as solvents. Here, the capability to monitor the solvent exchange process within the micropores of silica with millisecond time resolution is demonstrated, by simply embedding a rotor-based fluorophore (thioflavin T) in colloidal silica nanoparticles. Basically, the silica provides an extreme case of viscous microenvironment, which is affected by the polarity of the solvents. The fluorescence intensity traces can be well fitted to the Fickian diffusion model, allowing analytical solution of the diffusion process, and revealing the diffusion coefficients. The validation experiments, involving the water-to-ethanol and ethanol-to-water solvent exchange, the comparison of different drying conditions, and the variation in the degree of cross-linking in silica, confirmed the effectiveness and sensitivity of this method for characterizing diffusion in silica micropores. This work focuses on the method development of measuring diffusivity and the high temporal resolution in tracking solvent exchange dynamics over a short distance (within 165 nm) opens enormous possibilities for further studies.},

	title={Combined Dynamic Virtual Spatiotemporal Graph Mapping for Traffic Prediction},
    abstract={The continuous expansion of the urban construction scale has recently contributed to the demand for the dynamics of traffic intersections that are managed, making adaptive modellings become a hot topic. Existing deep learning methods are powerful to fit complex heterogeneous graphs. However, they still have drawbacks, which can be roughly classified into two categories, 1) spatiotemporal async-modelling approaches separately consider temporal and spatial dependencies, resulting in weak generalization and large instability while aggregating; 2) spatiotemporal sync-modelling is hard to capture long-term temporal dependencies because of the local receptive field. In order to overcome above challenges, a \textbf{C}ombined \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{V}irtual spatiotemporal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{M}apping \textbf{(CDVGM)} is proposed in this work. The contributions are the following: 1) a dynamic virtual graph Laplacian (DVGL) is designed, which considers both the spatial signal passing and the temporal features simultaneously; 2) the Long-term Temporal Strengthen model (LT2S) for improving the stability of time series forecasting; Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDVGM has excellent performances of fast convergence speed and low resource consumption and achieves the current SOTA effect in terms of both accuracy and generalization.},
