### About

"How can AI discover new scientific mechanisms?" This is the fundamental question driving his research.

In 2025, he introduced **scientific principles** as optimizable objects within multi-agent systems for scientific discovery, treating them as the medium for discovery. This led to a novel method that iteratively updates hypotheses by accumulating experimental evidence to *optimize* underlying principles [(Pu et al., 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15047). He subsequently expanded this into a unified framework based on dynamic principle space evolution [(Pu et al., 2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06448). This system not only leverages existing scientific laws for exploration but also employs information-theoretic approaches to update the principle space itself, enabling anomaly-driven principle augmentation.

Mellen Y. Pu is a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Engineering at Westlake University, under the joint mentorship of **Prof. [Tao Lin](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/tao-lin.html)** and **Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Prof. [Hongyu Chen](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/hongyu-chen.html)**. 
He is currently focusing on **Principle-Aware Scientific Discovery**. He looks forward to long-term cooperation and extensive exchanges on **<u>Agentic Learning and Evolving</u>** in general domains.
